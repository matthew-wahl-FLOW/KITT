# Schematics

Simple: Index of hardware schematics.
Technical: Notes schematic scope, usage, and revision handling.

This folder contains circuit schematics and wiring diagrams for the layout hardware.

## Contents
- Power distribution schematic (track power, accessory power).
- Controller interface schematic (microcontrollers, IO expanders).
- Sensor circuit schematic (block detection, RFID readers).

## Usage
- Open files in a PDF viewer or schematic editor.
- Use the same revision number in filenames as the hardware build notes.

## Missing Info
- Inputs: source files and tool versions used to generate the schematics.
- Outputs: published PDF names and their revision numbers.
- Actions: update process when circuits are changed or re-routed.
- Methods: review checklist for electrical safety and load limits.
